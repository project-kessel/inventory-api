# Programming Rules

## Core Principles

### 1. Minimal Code Addition
Add only code that is needed at the moment. It is much easier to add code later than to remove it.

- Do not add methods or functions that are not needed by the current use case
- Avoid "future-proofing" with unused code
- Keep the codebase lean and purposeful

### 2. Meaningful Comments Only
Do not add comments where they just add to redundancy. Only add comments when they explain something that the code does not.

- No comments that simply restate what the code does
- Only comment when explaining non-obvious behavior or business logic
- Let the code be self-documenting through clear naming and structure

### 3. No Extra Comments
Do not add unnecessary explanatory comments for obvious code patterns or standard language idioms.

- Omitting struct fields to use zero values needs no comment
- Standard Go patterns should speak for themselves
- Trust that other developers understand common language constructs
