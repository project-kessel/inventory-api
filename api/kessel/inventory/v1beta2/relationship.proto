// A _Relationship_ is the realization of a _Relation_ (a string)
// between a _Resource_ and a _Subject_ or a _Subject Set_ (known as a Userset in Zanzibar).
//
// All Relationships are object-object relations.
// "Resource" and "Subject" are relative terms which define the direction of a Relation.
// That is, Relations are unidirectional.
// If you reverse the Subject and Resource, it is a different Relation and a different Relationship.
// Conventionally, we generally refer to the Resource first, then Subject,
// following the direction of typical graph traversal (Resource to Subject).
